This code uses the GeoIP2 library to lookup the location information for the specified IP address. 
You'll need to download the GeoLite2-City database file and specify its path in the db_path variable. 
The code then opens the database and uses the city method to lookup the location information for the specified IP address. 
Finally, it prints out the city, state, country, latitude, and longitude information for the IP address.
